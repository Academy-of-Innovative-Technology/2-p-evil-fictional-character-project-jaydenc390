        <p class="page-information about-information about-information-top all-about">The Joker is a supervillain
            appearing in American comic
            books
            published by DC
            Comics. Created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson, the character first appeared in the debut
            issue of the comic book Batman on April 25, 1940. Credit for the Joker's creation is disputed; Kane and
            Robinson claimed responsibility for his design while acknowledging Finger's writing contribution. Although
            the Joker was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial
            intervention, allowing the character to endure as the archenemy of the superhero Batman.</p>
        <p class="page-information about-information all-about">In the DC Universe, the Joker is portrayed as a criminal
            mastermind and the
            antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance. He was introduced as a murderous psychopath with a
            warped, sadistic sense of humor but became a comical prankster in the late 1950s in response to regulation
            by the Comics Code Authority, before returning to his darker roots during the early 1970s. The Joker has
            been part of defining Batman stories, including the murder of Jason Todd—the second Robin and Batman's
            ward—in "A Death in the Family" (1988) and the paralysis of Barbara Gordon—the first Batgirl—in The Killing
            Joke (1988). Unlike many comic book characters, the Joker does not have a definitive origin story, but
            various possible ones have been developed. The most common story involves him falling into a tank of
            chemical waste that bleaches his skin white, turns his hair green and lips red, and leaves him with a rictus
            grin; the resulting disfigurement drives him insane.</p>
        <p class="page-information about-information all-about">The Joker possesses no superhuman abilities, instead
            using his
            expertise in chemical engineering to develop poisonous or lethal concoctions and thematic weaponry,
            including razor-tipped playing cards, deadly joy buzzers, and acid-spraying lapel flowers. The Joker
            sometimes works with other Gotham City criminals, such as the Penguin and Two-Face, and supervillain groups
            like the Injustice Gang and Injustice League, but these partnerships often collapse due to the Joker's
            desire for unbridled chaos. A romantic interest and sidekick for the Joker, his former psychiatrist Harley
            Quinn, was introduced in the 1990s. Although his primary obsession is Batman, the Joker has also fought
            other heroes, including Superman and Wonder Woman.</p>
        <p class="page-information about-information all-about">One of the most recognized characters in popular
            culture, the
            Joker has been listed among the greatest comic book villains and fictional characters ever created. His
            likeness has appeared on merchandise such as clothing and collectible items, and he has inspired real-world
            structures (such as theme park attractions) and been referenced in various media. The Joker has been adapted
            in live-action, animated, and video game incarnations.</p>
